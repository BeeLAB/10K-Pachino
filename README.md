# 10K-Pachino

Entry for 10k apart challenge.

A very tiny time-management app for [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)Â® lovers. 

The app has been built with simple HMTL, CSS and Javascript, using Notifications to warn you when a pomodoro has gone (25min)  and Local Storage to track your progress and save your tasks.

Demo [here](https://github.com/BeeLAB/10K-Pachino).
